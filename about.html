                <p>Iâ€™m an upcoming ASU Barrett honors alumna studying human systems engineering, UX. I got exposure to a handful of subjects during my undergraduate. I switched my academic major six times but ultimately fell in love with UX Research.</p>

                    <h3>Laura loves to travel!</h3>
                    <p>I am a sucker for exploring new places and love to travel, but if I had to pick a favorite city to visit, it would be a tie between Seattle, Washington, and Kona, Hawaii!</p>

                    <h3>Laura loves to climb!</h3>
                    <p>I love being in nature, whether hiking in the mountains or kayaking down the salt river. I recently joined the bouldering scene and can't wait to try climbing outdoors!</p>

                    <h3>Laura loves to create!</h3>
                    <p>I was a part of DesertWAVE (Women in Autonomous Vehicle Engineering) for two years and learned how to CADD and solder. I helped to design a marker dropper and a grabber-arm for our underwater robot! After this time, my interests shifted to user experience and visual communications.</p>
